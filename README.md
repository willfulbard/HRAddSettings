# Add settings to HR workstations

This script will add some settings that I personally like to use in workstations to an HR workstation (git aliases, vim settings, cmd line aliases, soft links, etc). This is a non-destructive script, copying any file it intends to edit to the same directory with a .hrorig extention.

## Installation
1.  run `git clone https://github.com/willfulbard/HRAddSettings.git` in the machine's home directory
2.  run `chmod 775 ~/HRAddSettings/install.sh`
3.  Run the `~/HRAddSettings/install.sh` to add the settings.
